Robombs

Multiplayer bombing fun - a free LAN game inspired by Bomberman!

I did NOT write this game. Source of this game is taken from

I only made some minor modification of the game to make it, IMHO, more fun.


Third party sources used by Robombs:

- J-Ogg - collection of Java libraries for reading Ogg files and decoding
  different contained formats (http://www.j-ogg.de)
- Paulscode (http://www.paulscode.com)

To run this game you still need game data from http://jpct.de/robombs.game.
